# High-Quality SR&ED Narrative Examples

## Purpose
This file is a placeholder for collecting 2-3 excellent SR&ED technical narrative examples from publicly available sources.

## Where to Find Examples

### Recommended Sources
1. **SR&ED Consulting Firm Blogs:**
   - Many firms publish sanitized, anonymized examples as marketing material
   - Search terms: "SR&ED software narrative example", "SR&ED technical narrative sample"
   
2. **CRA Website:**
   - Some example claims are published in CRA guidance documents
   - Look for case studies in T4088 appendices or policy documents

3. **Industry Associations:**
   - Canadian Technology Accelerators
   - Provincial innovation agencies often have SR&ED resources

### What to Look For in Good Examples
- Clear articulation of technological uncertainty (not just business risk)
- Specific description of experiments, tests, or investigations performed
- Concrete evidence of technological advancement achieved
- Professional tone suitable for government submission
- Structured format aligned with T661 form sections

## Collection Checklist

- [ ] Example 1: Software development project (relevant to our target users)
- [ ] Example 2: Different technical domain for contrast
- [ ] Example 3: Successful claim with clear structure

## Analysis Points

For each example collected, document:
1. **What makes it strong:** Specific phrases, structure, tone
2. **Key vocabulary used:** Technical terms, SR&ED-specific language
3. **Structure pattern:** How it flows from uncertainty → investigation → advancement
4. **Length and detail level:** Appropriate depth for CRA assessors

## Usage in Project

These examples will:
1. Guide our LLM prompt design (show the model what "good" looks like)
2. Help test the quality of generated narratives (comparison benchmark)
3. Inform the tone and structure we want our app to produce
4. Provide vocabulary and phrasing patterns for the "Poor Man's RAG"

## Notes

- Focus on **software development** examples when possible (aligns with target user base)
- Avoid examples with proprietary technical details
- Look for diversity in project types (web, mobile, ML, infrastructure, etc.)
- Pay attention to how they handle common pitfalls (avoiding "routine work" claims)
