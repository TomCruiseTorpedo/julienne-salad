**Key Sections to Reference:**

#### Part 2 - Project Information
This section describes what you need to include in your SR&ED claim. Focus on these lines:

**Line 242: Scientific or Technological Uncertainties**
- What was the scientific or technological uncertainty?
- What was it about the work that could not be determined or known from prior knowledge or experience?
- The uncertainty must be technological in nature, not commercial or routine engineering challenges.

**Line 244: Work Performed**
- Describe the systematic investigation or search carried out.
- What experiments or analyses were performed?
- What hypotheses were tested?
- What data was collected and analyzed?
- Show a methodical, planned process of investigation.

**Line 246: Scientific or Technological Advancements**
- What new knowledge or capability was gained?
- How did this work advance the understanding of the underlying technology?
- Note: This is an advancement in the **technology itself**, not just in the product or business outcome.

## Eligibility Criteria Summary

### Three Questions for SR&ED Eligibility
1. **Scientific or technological advancement:** Did the work seek to achieve a scientific or technological advancement?
2. **Scientific or technological uncertainty:** Was there scientific or technological uncertainty that could not be addressed through routine engineering or standard procedures?
3. **Systematic investigation:** Was there a systematic investigation or search carried out by qualified personnel?

If the answer to all three is "yes," the work likely qualifies for SR&ED.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Routine work:** Standard engineering, quality control, or minor bug fixes are not SR&ED.
- **Business uncertainty:** Market risk, business strategy, or customer requirements alone do not qualify.
- **Product advancement only:** If the work improved the product but not the underlying technology, it may not qualify.
- **Lack of documentation:** Claims require evidence of systematic investigation (logs, tests, results).

## Useful CRA Resources

- **SR&ED Self-Assessment and Learning Tool (SALT):** Interactive tool to assess eligibility
- **CRA SR&ED Consultations:** Pre-submission consultations available with CRA officers
- **SR&ED Policy Documents:** Additional guidance on specific topics (software development, material testing, etc.)

## Research Action Items

- [ ] Download T4088 PDF and extract text from Lines 242, 244, 246 sections
- [ ] Download Form T661 fillable PDF to understand field structure
- [ ] Collect 2-3 high-quality example narratives from consulting firms
- [ ] Use CRA SALT tool to understand common eligibility scenarios
- [ ] Review CRA policy documents on software development SR&ED (if applicable)

## Notes for Prompt Engineering

The CRA guidelines emphasize:
1. **Clarity:** Technical narratives should be understandable to a technically-trained assessor
2. **Specificity:** Avoid vague claims; provide concrete details of the work performed
3. **Linking:** Connect the uncertainty → investigation → advancement clearly
4. **Evidence:** Reference specific experiments, tests, results, and conclusions

These principles should guide our LLM prompt design.
